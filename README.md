# dictionary-ts

This is a variation of the dictionary written in Ð¢ypeScript.
Enter a word in the input field (I recommend starting with "cat"), press the button, and the meanings of the word will appear on the screen + you can listen to how the word is pronounced.
Unfortunately, not all words in the dictionary have an audio recording.
